          <h1 id="program-testing-goals">Program Testing Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>To <strong>demonstrate</strong> to the developer and the customer that the software meets its requirements. (leads to <strong>validation testing</strong>)</li>
<li>To <strong>discover</strong> situations in which the behavior of the software is incorrect, undesirable or does not conform to its specification. (leads to <strong>defect testing</strong>)</li>
<li>Testing can only show the presence of errors in a program. It <strong>cannot demonstrate that there are no remaining faults</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="verification-vs-validation">Verification vs Validation</h1>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Are we building the product right”.</strong></li>
<li>The software should conform to its specification.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Are we building the right product”.</strong></li>
<li>The software should do what the user really requires.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="inspections-and-testing">Inspections And Testing</h1>
<h2 id="software-inspections">Software inspections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Concerned with analysis of the static system representation to discover problems  (<strong>static verification</strong>)</li>
<li>May be supplement by tool-based document and code analysis.</li>
<li>These involve <strong>people examining the source representation</strong> with the aim of discovering anomalies and defects.</li>
<li>Inspections <strong>not require execution</strong> of a system so may be <strong>used before implementation</strong>.</li>
<li>They have been shown to be an effective technique for discovering program errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-testing">Software testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Concerned with exercising and observing product behaviour (<strong>dynamic verification</strong>)</li>
<li>The system is executed with <strong>test data</strong> and its operational behaviour is observed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/2020/04/se-notes7/Picture1.png" alt="Pic"></p>
<ul>
<li>Inspections and testing are <strong>complementary</strong> and not opposing verification techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Both</strong> should be used during the V &amp; V process.</li>
<li>Inspections can check conformance with a specification but not conformance with the <strong>customer’s real requirements</strong>.</li>
<li>Inspections cannot check <strong>non-functional characteristics</strong> such as performance, usability, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="test-data-and-test-cases">Test Data And Test Cases</h1>
<h2 id="test-data">Test data</h2>
<p>Inputs which have been devised to test the system.</p>
<h2 id="test-case">Test case</h2>
<p>Inputs to test the system and the <strong>predicted outputs</strong> from these inputs if the system operates according to its specification.</p>
<h1 id="choosing-test-case">Choosing Test Case</h1>
<h2 id="black-box-testing">Black-box testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>An approach to testing where the program is considered as a ‘black-box’.</li>
<li>The program test cases are based on the <strong>system specification</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="white-box-testing">White-box testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Derivation of test cases according to <strong>program structure</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge of the program</strong> is used to identify additional test cases.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="stages-of-testing">Stages of Testing</h1>
<h2 id="development-testing">Development testing</h2>
<p>Development testing includes all testing activities that are carried out by the team developing the system.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit testing</strong>, where individual program units or object classes are tested. Unit testing should focus on <strong>testing the functionality of objects or methods</strong>. (Whenever possible, unit testing should <strong>be automated</strong> so that tests are run and checked without manual intervention.) (Automated test components: a <strong>setup part</strong>, a <strong>call part</strong>, an <strong>assertion part</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Component testing</strong>, where several individual units are integrated to create composite components. Component testing should focus on <strong>testing component interfaces</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>System testing</strong>, where some or all of the components in a system are integrated and the system is tested as a whole. System testing should focus on <strong>testing component interactions</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="release-testing">Release testing</h2>
<p>A separate testing team test a complete version of the system before it is released to users.</p>
<h2 id="user-testing">User testing</h2>
<p>Users or potential users of a system test the system in their own environment.</p>
<h1 id="testing-strategies-unit-testing">Testing Strategies (Unit Testing)</h1>
<h2 id="partition-testing-black-box">Partition testing (Black-box)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Where you identify groups of inputs that have <strong>common characteristics</strong> and should be processed in the same way.</li>
<li>Input data and output results often fall into different classes where all members of a class are <strong>related</strong>.</li>
<li>Each of these classes is an <strong>equivalence partition</strong> or domain where the program behaves in an equivalent way for each class member.</li>
<li>Test cases should be <strong>chosen from each partition</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guideline-based-testing">Guideline-based testing</h2>
<p>Where you use testing guidelines to choose test cases.</p>
<h3 id="general-testing-guidelines">General testing guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose inputs that force the system to generate all error messages.</li>
<li>Design inputs that cause input buffers to overflow.</li>
<li>Repeat the same input or series of inputs numerous times.</li>
<li>Force invalid outputs to be generated.</li>
<li>Force computation results to be too large or too small.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structural-testing-white-box">Structural testing (White-box)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Derivation of test cases <strong>according to program structure</strong>. Knowledge of the program is used to identify additional test cases.</li>
<li>Objective is to <strong>exercise all program statements</strong> (not all path combinations)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/2020/04/se-notes7/Picture3.png" alt="Pic"></p>
<h2 id="path-testing">Path testing</h2>
<p>The objective of path testing is to ensure that the set of test cases is such that <strong>each path through the program is executed at least once</strong>.  <br>
The starting point for path testing is a <strong>program flow graph</strong> that shows nodes representing program decisions and arcs representing the flow of control.   <br>
Statements with conditions are therefore nodes in the flow graph.</p>
<h3 id="program-flow-graphs">Program flow graphs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Describes the program control flow.</strong> Each branch is shown as a separate path and loops are shown by arrows looping back to the loop condition node.</li>
<li>Used as a basis for computing the <strong>cyclomatic complexity</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Cyclomatic complexity = Number of edges - Number of nodes +2</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cyclomatic-complexity">Cyclomatic complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The number of tests</strong> to test all control statements equals the cyclomatic complexity.</li>
<li>Cyclomatic complexity equals <strong>number of conditions in a program</strong>.</li>
<li>Useful if used with care. <strong>Does not imply adequacy of testing</strong>.</li>
<li>Although all paths are executed, <strong>all combinations of paths</strong> are not executed.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="component-testing">Component Testing</h1>
<p>Software components are often composite components that are <strong>made up of several interacting objects</strong>.      <br>
You access the functionality of these objects through the defined component interface. Testing composite components should therefore focus on showing that the <strong>component interface</strong> behaves according to its specification.   <br>
You can assume that unit tests on the individual objects within the component have been completed.</p>
<h2 id="interface-testing">Interface testing</h2>
<p><img src="/images/2020/04/se-notes7/Picture4.png" alt="Pic">
Objectives are to <strong>detect faults due to interface errors or invalid assumptions about interfaces</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="interface-types">Interface types</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parameter interfaces.</strong> Data passed from one method or procedure to another.</li>
<li><strong>Shared memory interfaces.</strong> Block of memory is shared between procedures or functions.</li>
<li><strong>Procedural interfaces.</strong> Sub-system encapsulates a set of procedures to be called by other sub-systems.</li>
<li><strong>Message passing interfaces.</strong> Sub-systems request services from other sub-systems.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface-errors">Interface errors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interface misuse</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interface misunderstanding</strong></li>
<li><strong>Timing errors</strong> (The called and the calling component operate at different speeds and out-of-date information is accessed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface-testing-guidelines">Interface testing guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Design tests so that parameters to a called procedure are at the <strong>extreme ends of their ranges</strong>.</li>
<li>Always test pointer parameters with <strong>null pointers</strong>.</li>
<li>Design tests which <strong>cause the component to fail</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>stress testing</strong> in message passing systems.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In shared memory systems,<strong>vary the order</strong> in which components are activated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="system-testing">System Testing</h1>
<p>System testing during development involves <strong>integrating components to create a version of the system</strong> and then <strong>testing the integrated system</strong>.  <br>
The focus in system testing is <strong>testing the interactions between components</strong>.      <br>
System testing checks that components are <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>interact correctly</strong> and <strong>transfer the right data at the right time</strong> across their interfaces.  <br>
System testing tests the <strong>emergent behaviour</strong> of a system.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-testing">Use-case testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>The use-cases developed to <strong>identify system interactions</strong> can be used as <strong>a basis for system testing</strong>.</li>
<li>Each use case usually involves several system components so <strong>testing the use case forces these interactions to occur</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The sequence diagrams associated with the use case</strong> documents the components and interactions that are being tested.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="test-driven-development">Test-driven Development</h1>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is an approach to program development in which you <strong>inter-leave testing and code development</strong>.   <br>
<strong>Tests are written before code</strong> and ‘passing’ the tests is the critical driver of development. <br>
TDD was introduced as part of <strong>agile methods</strong> such as Extreme Programming. However, it can also be used in <strong>plan-driven development</strong> processes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/04/se-notes7/Picture5.png" alt="Pic"></p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-test-driven-development">Benefits of test-driven development</h2>
<h3 id="code-coverage">Code coverage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every code segment that you write has at least one associated test so <strong>all code written has at least one test</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="regression-testing">Regression testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>A regression test suite is developed incrementally as a program is developed.</li>
<li>Regression testing is testing the system to <strong>check that changes have not ‘broken’ previously working code</strong>.</li>
<li>In a manual testing process, regression testing is expensive but, with <strong>automated testing</strong>, it is simple and straightforward. <strong>All tests are rerun every time a change is made to the program</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simplified-debugging">Simplified debugging</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a test fails, it should be obvious where the problem lies. The newly written code needs to be checked and modified.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="system-documentation">System documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The tests themselves are a form of documentation that describe what the code should be doing.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="release-testing-1">Release Testing</h1>
<p>The primary goal of the release testing process is to <strong>convince the supplier of the system that it is good enough for use</strong>.    <br>
Release testing is usually a <strong>black-box testing process</strong> where tests are only derived from the <strong>system specification</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="release-testing-and-system-testing">Release testing and system testing</h2>
<p>Release testing is <strong>a form of system testing</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="important-differences">Important differences:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A separate team that has not been involved in the system development, should be responsible for release testing.</li>
<li><strong>System testing</strong> by the development team should focus on <strong>discovering bugs in the system</strong> (<strong>defect testing</strong>). The objective of <strong>release testing</strong> is to <strong>check that the system meets its requirements and is good enough for external use</strong> (<strong>validation testing</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="requirements-based-testing">Requirements based testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Requirements-based testing involves examining each requirement and developing a test or tests for it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scenario-testing">Scenario testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>An approach to release testing whereby you devise <strong>typical scenarios of use</strong> and use these scenarios to develop test cases.</li>
<li>A scenario is a story that describes one way in which the system might be used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-testing">Performance testing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Performance tests usually involve planning a series of tests where <strong>the load is steadily increased</strong> until the system performance becomes unacceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Stress testing is a form of performance testing</strong> where the system is deliberately overloaded to test its failure behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="user-testing-1">User Testing</h1>
<p>User or customer testing is a stage in the testing process in which <strong>users or customers</strong> provide input and advice on system testing.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-user-testing">Types of User Testing</h2>
<h3 id="alpha-testing">Alpha testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Users of the software <strong>work with the development team</strong> to test the software at the developer’s site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="beta-testing">Beta testing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A release of the software</strong> is made available to users to allow them to experiment and to raise problems that they discover with the system developers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acceptance-testing">Acceptance testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Customers test a system to decide whether or not it is ready to be accepted from the system developers and deployed in the customer environment. Primarily for custom systems.</li>
</ul>
