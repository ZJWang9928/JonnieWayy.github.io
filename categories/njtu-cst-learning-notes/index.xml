      <description>System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. System modeling helps the analyst to understand the functionality of the system and models are used to communicate with customers. Unified Modeling Language (UML) The UML is the standard language for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. It can be used</description>

      <description>Types Of Requirement User requirements: Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for customers. System requirements: A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints. Defines what should be implemented so may be part of a contract between client and contractor. Functional And Non-functional Requirements Functional requirements</description>

      <description>Agile Methods Features Focus on the code rather than the design. Are based on an iterative approach to software development. Are intended to deliver working software quickly and evolve this quickly to meet changing requirements. The aim of agile methods is to reduce overheads in the software process (e.g. by limiting documentation) and to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements without excessive rework. The principles of agile methods</description>

      <description>Software Process Software processes are the activities involved in producing a software system. General Software process models: The waterfall model, Incremental development, Reuse-oriented software engineering. Waterfall model phases: Requirements analysis and definition, System and software design, Implementation and unit testing, Integration and system testing, Operation and maintenance. The main drawback of the waterfall model: the difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. (In principle, a phase has to</description>
